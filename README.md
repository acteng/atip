# Active Travel Infrastructure Platform

A very early prototype, without explanation. Go play with <https://acteng.github.io/atip>.

## Development

We use [Vite](https://vitejs.dev). You'll just need to set up
[npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm). Then
just `npm install` once, and `npm run dev` after that.

To auto-format code, `npm run fmt`.
