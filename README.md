# Active Travel Infrastructure Platform

ATIP lets you sketch new plans for walking and cycling infrastructure with a
low level of detail. See the initial version at
<https://acteng.github.io/atip>.

## Using ATIP

If you're in England, go use the development version at <https://acteng.github.io/atip>. Note this is not a production service; we make no guarantees about the site's uptime or about backwards compatibility of ATIP files.

You can run ATIP anywhere in the world, but you'll need some technical experience to get started. Right now the developers can't commit to helping with other deployments, but we're open to pull requests making deploying elsewhere easily. Please [file an issue](https://github.com/acteng/atip/issues/new) to start a conversation about this.

Very roughly, you'd need to:

1.  Replace `assets/authorities.geojson` with appropriate boundaries for your region, and adjust Svelte components using this file
2.  Generate files for the route-snapper tool to work, using <https://github.com/acteng/abstreet-to-atip/>. Right now, this only requires OpenStreetMap data and should work worldwide, but this may change.
3.  Host those files and a compiled version of this Svelte app somewhere. You only need a static file host, like S3.

## Development

The stack:

- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev) as the build tool
- [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) as the UI framework
- [MapLibre GL](https://maplibre.org) as the map
- [route-snapper](https://github.com/dabreegster/route_snapper/) to draw routes
  snapped to existing roads

You'll need
[npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm). Run
`npm install` once. Use `npm run dev` to work locally. To auto-format code,
`npm run fmt`. To see TypeScript errors, `npm run check`.

### Monkey-patching dependencies

If you need to temporarily modify an NPM dependency (like say `route-snapper`), you can:

1.  Manually modify something in `node_modules/`
2.  `rm -rf node_modules/.vite; npm run dev`
3.  The change should take effect. If not, Ctrl+Shift+R in browser to force a refresh

To clean up afterwards, delete `node_modules` and `npm i` again.

### Tests

We use [Playwright](https://playwright.dev). Run all tests: `npm run test`

To develop a test interactively, `npm run test -- --debug`. You can step
through a test line-by-line with a browser open. Press "record" and then
interact with the page normally, generating the equivalent test code.

### HMR best practices

[Hot module replacement](https://vitejs.dev/guide/features.html#hot-module-replacement) means you can edit source code and have just that Svelte component live-reload in the browser, without needing to do anything. It's incredibly useful for rapid iteration, especially for simple things like styling. There are some gotchas to keep it working:

- Use `overwriteSource` and `overwriteLayer` instead of `map.addSource` and `map.addLayer`
- Within a `.ts` file using classes, use `EventManager` to handle MapLibre and document event handlers. Otherwise as you edit a component, you'll keep running old versions of the callbacks!
- Within a Svelte component, express event handlers using functions and remember to call `map.off()` within `onDestroy`. Refer to existing components.
- When in doubt, Ctrl+Shift+R to hard refresh and get rid of any possible HMR weirdness

### Overall app state

Simple state is isolated to a component when possible. Most of the app-wide state is setup in `stores.js`.

- The `map` store has the MapLibre map. Components everywhere need to do something to it, so it's a global singleton
- The `gjScheme` store is the source-of-truth GeoJSON for the current data. It's automatically synced to local storage.
  - Feature IDs are unique, numeric, and always start at 1. See `newFeatureId`. They are **not** stable over time; if you load a file or refresh the page and load from local storage, some of the IDs may adjust.
  - Each feature has 3 simple fields -- `name`, `description`, and `intervention_type` (`area`, `route`, `crossing`, `other`). Anything produced by the route tool will also have `length_meters`, `waypoints`.
  - `InterventionLayer` renders these "finalized" features.
  - The `editing` property is temporarily set in `gjScheme` to indicate that a feature is having its attributes edited. The form in the sidebar should be open. There's a derived store `currentlyEditing` and a `setCurrentlyEditing` that should generally be used, instead of manipulating this property directly.
  - When editing geometry of a feature, the `hide_while_editing` property is set. `InterventionLayer` skips drawing these, so something else can draw the actively-being-modified state.

### Modes

Interactions on the map are split into distinct and exclusive modes. `Toolbox.svelte` manages these.

Be very careful with [reactive statements](https://svelte.dev/tutorial/reactive-statements) and modifying `mode` directly. Instead, use `changeMode`, which will call the previous mode's `stop()` and the new's `start()`. The modes share some underlying stateful (and not Svelte-friendly) objects (`point_tool`, `polygon_tool`, and `route-snapper`), and managing these objects and listening to events can get tricky, especially in the middle of switching modes. See [this article](https://blog.thoughtspile.tech/2023/04/22/svelte-state/) to understand Svelte reactive statements better.

### Schemas

It's helpful to think of ATIP as a somewhat generic data entry system. Per object ("intervention") drawn on the map, the app has a form to collect properties about the object. Multiple schemas are supported -- v1, v2, and planning are some examples.

At the time of writing, v1 and planning are manually implemented in the form of TypeScript types and a Svelte component for the form. v2 is auto-generated from `src/schemas/v2_route.json`. There's a generic Svelte component that can auto-generate a form from this schema, and `npm run generate-schema-ts` auto-generates the TypeScript types. `v2_route.json` is written in a bespoke format; see code for more details.
