# Plan Your Active Travel Schemes

This repository contains the Scheme Sketcher and Scheme Browser, two tools for mapping active travel schemes and viewing them alongside contextual layers. The tools re developed by the Alan Turing Institute in collaboration with Active Travel England.

## Usage

The development version is available for use at <https://acteng.github.io/atip>. Note this is not a production service and we make no guarantees about the site's uptime or about backwards compatibility of sketch files.

See the [developer guide](docs/developer_guide.md) if you want to work on the code.

### Usage in other places

You can set up the Scheme Sketcher for another country, using [the common library](https://github.com/acteng/scheme-sketcher-lib). You'll need technical experience to do this. Please [file an issue](https://github.com/acteng/atip/issues/new) to start a conversation.
